🧠 **Personality Predictor**

This project is a machine learning-based personality classifier that predicts whether a user is an **Introvert** or **Extrovert** based on their social behavior inputs. The model is built using scikit-learn and deployed with an interactive, user-friendly interface using Streamlit.

- 💡 Advanced feature engineering with polynomial features and custom metrics  
- ⚙️ Preprocessing with imputation, scaling, and categorical encoding  
- 🌐 Interactive web interface using Streamlit for easy input and results  
- 🧪 Binary classification (0 = Extrovert, 1 = Introvert) with confidence scores  
- 📊 Example prediction to demonstrate model behavior
